# Georelays Assets

This directory contains generated assets for the Georelays project:

## bitchat_relay_count_chart.png

A chart showing the history of the number of BitChat-compatible relays (supporting kind 20000 events) in the `nostr_relays.csv` file over time.

## total_relay_count_chart.png

A chart showing the history of the total number of functioning relays discovered in the `relay_discovery_results.json` file over time.

These charts are automatically generated by the GitHub workflow after each update to the relay data.
They track the last 30 changes to the relay lists and plot them on time series graphs.
